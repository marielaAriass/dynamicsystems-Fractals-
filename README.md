## Introduction 
A fractal is a geometric object characterized by presenting a structure that is repeated.  

Fractals are infinitely complex patterns that are self-similar across different scales. They are created by repeating a simple process over and over in an ongoing feedback loop. Driven by recursion, fractals are images of dynamic systems â€“ the pictures of chaos

## Methodology

With the 'square' function we define the points of the square and in the 'fractal' function we call the 'square' function and thus we recurse the points.

## Toolset
The project is to be developed by making use of Python 3 libraries, including but not limited to:

* [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/)

* [Numpy](https://numpy.org/)
